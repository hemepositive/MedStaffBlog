### <div class="red">Alert: Use Only Sterile Ultrasound Gel for Percutaneous Procedures</div>

### Improper use of ultrasound gel risks patient safety

The CDC is assisting with an ongoing multistate investigation involving the use of non-sterile ultrasound gel for ultrasound-guided percutaneous procedures (procedures involving skin or tissue puncture). Product testing identified _Paraburkholderia fungorum_ (an environmental bacterium) from two non-sterile ultrasound gel products. Genetically similar isolates of _P. fungorum_ were also detected primarily from patient blood cultures; some of these patients were known to have undergone ultrasound-guided percutaneous procedures before culture collection.
