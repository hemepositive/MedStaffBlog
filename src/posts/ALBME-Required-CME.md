The ALBME has posted a 2025 CME requirement for all actively licensed physicians, physician assistants, and anesthesiologist assistants on professional boundaries. This is a one-time two-hour CME that is available online and free of charge.

### Navigating Professional Boundaries in Medicine

History: In 2020, a joint consultant group of the Board and Commission studied the increasing number of sexual misconduct and professional boundaries complaints against Alabama medical practitioners and what measures should be taken to address this increase. As part of the continuing effort to protect the health and safety of patients and educate licensees, mandatory professional boundaries education is being implemented for all physicians, physician assistants, and anesthesiologist assistants licensed in Alabama. The only licensees exempted from this requirement are limited licensees who are enrolled in a residency training program or a clinical fellowship.

Current Licensees: Effective January 2025, all actively licensed physicians, physician assistants, and anesthesiologist assistants are required to complete the two-hour on-demand course provided by PBI Education entitled “Navigating Professional Boundaries in Medicine.” The course is provided free of charge to all Alabama licensees and must be completed by December 31, 2025.
