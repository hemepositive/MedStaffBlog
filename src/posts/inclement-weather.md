The January 2024 ice storm highlighted a problem. Several on-call physicians could not make it in to see patients due to the roads. To be clear, providers are responsible for being here and caring for their patients.

This requirement is the same for non-provider hospital staff. Some staff stayed in local hotels or slept in a prepared area in the Med Mall to be available for their shifts. Some administrators, including myself, stayed overnight, unsure if they could return to the hospital. Another thing to consider is having a backup provider if you think your vehicle will fail to get you here. It is not a medical staff requirement to have a 4-wheel drive vehicle, but we should make every effort to come in.

We may be able to arrange transportation for on-call physicians and critical staff, but it's not a given. In the past, Rocket City Wranglers, the sheriff's department or rescue squad, has helped transport physicians who could not get here using their vehicles. During last month's storm, the administrator on-call, hospital president, VPMA, and others knew the options at the time.

The overall message is that, just like the hospital staff, you must be available to care for your patients and see consults if you are on-call. You should be prepared to stay or have a backup plan if you cannot get here. If, despite your best efforts, you cannot come in to see your patients, contact the administration, and we will see what we can do to help.
