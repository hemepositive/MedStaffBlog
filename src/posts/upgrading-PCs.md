Huntsville Hospital supports over 10,000 PCs across all Madison County campuses and almost 50 physician office locations. Our philosophy is to replace computers when they break or when their model no longer has the capacity to run our ever-increasing application requirements. The average life of a PC is between 6-7 years.

Currently, we are replacing 6-7-year-old PCs with Windows 11-capable models. As our vendors qualify their applications on Windows 11, we hope to begin that process later this fiscal year.

Whenever you encounter an issue with a specific PC and suspect it needs repair or replacement, please call the help desk at 5-7777. It would be helpful if you could provide the IP address (the Help Desk can assist you in finding it) and a brief description of the problem you are experiencing.
