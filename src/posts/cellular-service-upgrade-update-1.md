We're pleased to provide an update on the cellular service upgrade project at Huntsville Hospital.

As previously communicated, both Verizon and AT&T have been working to expand their Distributed Array Service (DAS) throughout our facilities. This project aims to significantly improve signal strength and increase connection capacity for staff, patients, and visitors.

## Current Status

The infrastructure upgrades completed by Huntsville Hospital in August 2025 have successfully prepared our facilities to support the enhanced cellular services. Both carriers are now actively working on their equipment installations and are on track to complete their upgrades by the end of Q4 2025.

## What This Means for You

Once the upgrades are complete, you can expect:

- Stronger cellular signals throughout campus facilities
- Fewer dropped calls and connection issues
- Improved data speeds and performance
- Support for hundreds of simultaneous connections

## Ongoing Coordination

HH Information Technology continues to meet weekly with both Verizon and AT&T representatives to monitor progress and ensure timely completion of this important project.

We appreciate your continued patience as we work to enhance connectivity across our campus. If you have any questions or concerns about cellular service, please contact the IT Help Desk.

Thank you for your support.
