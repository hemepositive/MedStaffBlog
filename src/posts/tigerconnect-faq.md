### What is TigerConnect?

TigerConnect is a secure clinical communication platform used at Huntsville Hospital for HIPAA-compliant messaging between healthcare providers, staff, and care teams.

### Why is the hospital implementing TigerConnect?

Modern hospitals use secure-messaging as part of their workflows as communication is essential to efficient and safe patient care. HIPAA-compliance ensures our providers can relay important patient information without worry about their communication security.

### Is TigerConnect secure?

Yes, TigerConnect is HIPAA-compliant and uses end-to-end encryption to protect patient information and clinical communications.

### Can I use TigerConnect for patient information?

Yes, TigerConnect is specifically designed for secure clinical communication and is approved for discussing patient information, unlike standard text messaging.

### How do I find a colleague on TigerConnect?

Use the search function to find colleagues by name or role. You can also browse the directory to locate specific departments or care teams.

### What if I'm not receiving notifications?

Check your device notification settings and ensure TigerConnect has permission to send notifications. Also verify your in-app notification preferences are configured correctly.

### How can I tell if I sent a message to someone who has not activated their account?

The primary way a user can tell if they are messaging an unactivated TigerConnect account is by checking the message status. The message to an unactivated user will remain in the Sent status.

### I sent a message... How do I know they got it?

TigerConnect messages have four types of delivery confirmation:
Failed to deliver = message could not be delivered
Sent = message in route to the recipient
Delivered = message delivered to the recipient's device
Read = message read by the recipient
In general, closed-loop communication is key to effective communication. If you do not get a Read receipt or a text acknowledgement from the person you messaged, please do not assume they got your message. Please find another way to contact the person.

### What are the message statuses?

The “Sent” status indicates that a notification has been sent to the designated recipient, informing them that they have received a TigerConnect message. Following this, senders will see the status “Delivered” underneath the message. This means that the recipient has opened the TigerConnect app, and the message has been downloaded onto the server. Lastly, when recipients open the message or the existing correspondence, the message will be marked as “Read.” Each of these statuses enables TigerConnect users to understand how to proceed with tasks and projects appropriately based on the status of their message.

### Who do I contact for support?
