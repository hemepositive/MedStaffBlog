I wanted to update the medical staff on several IT-related issues, pending upgrades, and instructions you need to know.

### Helen Keller and Red Bay Cerner update

The IT team's primary efforts are working toward adding Helen Keller to our instance of Cerner. As this build progresses, we add Helen Keller patients to our production database. These patients have medical record numbers starting with "03". For now, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ignore patients with MRNs beginning with 03.

### Dragon Upgrade

Next week, Dragon will receive a significant upgrade. There are changes to the Dragon bar and other enhancements. Below is a link to a YouTube video for those who are interested in details. There's also a link to a tip sheet showing what the new bar will look like.

### Pharmacy - Therapeutic Substitution Medications

Pharmacy wanted providers to know how to order therapeutic equivalents when no pre-defined therapeutic substitution ("t-sub") exists in Cerner. Providers commonly encounter this during initial admission medication reconciliation.

### 2023 Physician Survey â€“ IT

The HH administration is reviewing the most recent physician survey results, including several IT-related complaints. The IT team does take your concerns seriously and wants to help you work as efficiently as possible. Several physicians noted that PCs were slow and needed updates. IT is working on these issues, and a more complete explanation of upgrading PCs is <a href="/upgrading-PCs/">here</a>.
