IT added several options to the DME Oxygen Orders to improve home oxygen ordering. As a default, patients on home oxygen generally receive large E tanks. Most patients request small B tanks or, optimally, a Portable Oxygen Concentrator, resulting in more ease of portable use. DME companies cannot provide their request without a matching physician order. Patients have expressed frustration as they don't know how to communicate this to their physician, and it often takes them some time for the change.

The following options were changed in the DME oxygen orders to give the patients an option of having a smaller tank:

- Portable Oxygen Concentrator w/conserving device
- Portable Oxygen Concentrator continuous
- Oxygen Portable Gas System w/conserving device
- Oxygen Portable Gas System continuous

Explanation of the types of Oxygen in the new order:

- Portable Oxygen Concentrator w/conserving device = a POC that delivers a pulse dose
- Portable Oxygen Concentrator continuous = a POC that delivers continuous oxygen
- Oxygen Portable Gas System w/conserving device = Smaller B tanks
- Oxygen Portable Gas System continuous = Standard larger E tanks
