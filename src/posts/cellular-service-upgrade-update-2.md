We wanted to provide an update regarding the in-building cellular service following the recent system upgrade. All equipment has been installed and connected. AT&T service is fully operational, and HH’s DAS vendor continues to work closely with Verizon to restore full Verizon service.
Verizon has assigned additional engineering resources, as requested, to expedite resolution and minimize further impact. We will continue to monitor progress and share updates as they become available.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as this work continues.
